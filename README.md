# legionmodpublic
public version of legionmod
Meme mod for Vanilla Vic2, supposed to be light for performance reasons

Combination of multiple mods, built on top of someone else's Alstadt mod that I got from "Nero's Paradox Spiel Gruppe"
Has elements from IGOR, Weevil Larp mod, a couple alt-history MP mods, probably could cite the entire Vic2 Modding Discord server for this thing

There are "guides" to some nations as decisions but they lowkey trash (i made the sandwich)
