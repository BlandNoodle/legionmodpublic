public version of legionmod
Half Meme Half Competitive Mod for Vanilla Vic2, supposed to be light for performance reasons

Combination of multiple mods, built on top of someone else's mod that I got from "Nero's Paradox Spiel Gruppe"
Ill try to summarize changes from base game with each nation

UK - 
India is sorta independent at start, Opium War has to be done to remove malus from trade imbalance
India can be annexed or turned to Raj after Sepoy Rebellion (rebellion fires after Empress of India)
after all of that UK is basically free to do whatever

FRA -
Mob sized nerfed, but they start with guards which are buffed and can get increased mob size from decisions
If they maintain spheres in South Germany they get modifiers and forts, if they sphere Bavaria by 1870 without GER or South GER forming they get south german accepted
They have a couple extra decisions but not much more yet

RUS - 
Choose one of the now infamous builds at game start. Vladivostok can be taken after Opium War and the Great Game can lead to ownership of Persia
There are a bunch of naval buffs if you get all decisions
Soviet Union can be formed through decision, with events and decisions that follow

GER - 
Forming Germany is changed so it isnt all at once, broken up into smaller parts and have year requirements
there is a cb for unifying germany but conquering the german states is otherwise not possible outside of decisions
Germany itself isnt nerfed other than some life rating changes which were lowered throughout Europe

AUS - 
Can either go for Austria Hungary or South Germany, holding Bavaria gives a modifier buff, holding Bavaria and getting Baden and Wurttemburg sphered by 1870 gives the modifier permanently and the tile from Prussia. Forming South Germany in this way keeps Hungary
Otherwise, forming South Germany without winning the contest over southern germany releases hungary when it is formed, get Czech accepted either way. Croat and Hungarian are accepted with A-H. 

SPA - 
Super buffed compared to base game, I'm just waiting for someone to abuse it before I stop buffing it, full of secrets

ITA - 
Similar to Spain, although its a little more obvious, I cant stop them from industrializing all over the place
Italy forms automatically whenever North Germany forms or by 1850, the pops are increased and some RGOS were changed
Garibaldis do not form Italy anymore

TUR - 
Can become Caliphate for accepted pops, Balkan, Anatolian, Caucasian, and Egyptian pops increased but there are more independent puppet states
decisions allow for integration but Egypt has Oriental Crisis to deal with (epic Crocodile vs Garp contest)
Broken nation if you are left to afk for 60 years

USA - 
I had to be prevented from super nerfing this thing, it exists but it never does anything cause all the action is in Europe or Asia
play Bolivia it has content from our resident Bolivia fan club

SWE and NET -
Other Minor nations like Sweden and Netherlands got pop buffs and a bunch of decisions to have something to do

JAP - 
Has decisions for mid game and late game msotly centered around conquering neighboring regions for historic map. Tends to have more game impact than USA just because its next to Asian colonies and China

The China Situation -
After the Opium War, treaty ports can be taken from each of the sphereling states, these states have cores that reach into the mainland for more RGOs, but the main China has cores on them too, so they have to be protected
If the Taiping Rebels win, nothing really happens they kinda just sit there unless they want to surprise me this time. Otherwise China modernizes once it has all its cores back or hits 1900. Warlords n such after that.
Opium Addict pops exist in uncivilized countries, but start in Canton and spread throughout Asia that way. They typically spread faster when they have no life needs/daily needs and do nothing otherwise.

Units - 
late game boats have been buffed a bunch, guards and cuirassiers are buffed, tanks are buffed, engineers got a little buff, attacking past 1900 becomes easier
Navies are by default super expensive, if youre losing money at game start, delete some boats.

I've probably forgotten something important, or left it out to be discovered.
